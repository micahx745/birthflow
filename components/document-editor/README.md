# Document Editor Component

This is a new implementation of the document editor feature, addressing several issues reported in the previous version:

## Fixed Issues

1. **Infinite loops in document processing**
   - Added proper cleanup in useEffect to prevent memory leaks
   - Added isMounted checks for asynchronous operations
   - Used debouncing for expensive operations

2. **Document rendering and editing issues**
   - Used proper memoization with useMemo and useCallback
   - Optimized the clone and rendering process for PDF exports
   - Improved event handling for drag operations

3. **Form field positioning and interactions problems**
   - Used rounded values for positions and sizes
   - Added minimum size constraints
   - Improved the resize handle styles and drag interactions

4. **Performance optimizations**
   - Debounced window resize events
   - Memoized element rendering in the preview component
   - Used functional state updates to prevent stale state

5. **State management improvements**
   - Used proper dependency arrays in useEffect and useCallback
   - Added cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks
   - Implemented more efficient state updates
